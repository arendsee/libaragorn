# Test Data

All tRNA test data was retrieved from https://trna.ie.niigata-u.ac.jp/. I
removed the carriage returns on the headers and the comment sections. Here is a
list of the downloaded sequences:

 * trna_sequence_chloro_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_cmp_arc_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_cmp_bac_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_fungi_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_phage_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_plant_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_plasmid_1.fasta
 * trna_sequence_virus_1.fasta

For testing purposes, this is a bit too much data, so I downsampled as follows:

``` bash
for j in trna*fasta
do
  awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"} NR % 2 == 1 {header=$1} NR % 2 == 0 {print header, $0}' $j | sed 's/ /_/g' |
    sort -R |
    head -10000 |
    awk '{print $1 "\n" $2}' > sample-$j
done
```

These examples are all spliced.

tRNA samples with introns are retrieved from https://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu
